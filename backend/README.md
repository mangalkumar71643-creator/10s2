# NovaPlay backend

Node.js + TypeScript + Express + PostgreSQL (Prisma).

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # then edit DATABASE_URL / JWT_SECRET
npm install
npm run prisma:migrate  # creates tables
npm run prisma:seed     # creates an admin user + a sample football event
npm run dev              # http://localhost:4000
```

Default seeded admin: `admin@novaplay.test` / `ChangeMe123!` — change the
password immediately in a real environment.

All authenticated routes take `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from
`/auth/login`, `/auth/register` or `/auth/otp/verify` /
`/auth/otp/complete-profile`.

### Phone auth via OTP (no Firebase)

The backend owns OTP generation and verification end to end — no
Firebase, no ID tokens. Three steps:

1. `POST /auth/otp/request { phone }` — generates a 6-digit code, stores
   its hash (5 min expiry), and sends it via `src/services/smsService.ts`.
   In `SMS_PROVIDER_MODE=mock` (default) no real SMS is sent; the response
   includes `{ devCode }` so the mobile app can display it for testing —
   never ship that mode to real users. `SMS_PROVIDER_MODE=live` sends a
   real SMS via **Fast2SMS** (`FAST2SMS_API_KEY` — an Indian gateway that
   accepts UPI, unlike Firebase's Blaze plan which needs an international
   card).
2. `POST /auth/otp/verify { phone, code }` — checks the code (max 5
   attempts, then a new code is required). An existing phone number logs
   straight in. A brand-new one gets `428 {"error":"profile_required"}`
   and stays in a "verified" state for 10 minutes.
3. `POST /auth/otp/complete-profile { phone, firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, country }`
   — only for new numbers, only within that 10-minute window (no need to
   re-enter the code). Creates the account, enforcing 18+ server-side.

### Games (`POST /games/:gameKey/play`)

Body: `{ stake, gameType: "coinflip" | "dice", target? }` (`target`, 2-98,
only applies to `dice` — the roll-under number the player picked; its
payout multiplier is always `rtp * 100 / target` so every target has the
same expected value). Outcomes are computed via
`src/services/fairnessService.ts` + `src/utils/rng.ts`: a secret
per-user server seed (committed via its SHA-256 hash, exposed through
`GET /games/fairness`) combined with a client seed and an incrementing
nonce through HMAC-SHA256. Rotating the seed (`POST
/games/fairness/rotate`) reveals the old one so every round played under
its hash can be recomputed and verified independently. This proves the
*process* wasn't tampered with — it is not the same as accredited RNG
certification, which a real licence still requires.

## Deploying to Vercel

This backend runs as a Vercel serverless function: `api/index.ts` exports
the Express app from `src/app.ts` (unchanged from local dev — only
`src/index.ts`'s `app.listen()` is skipped in serverless mode), and
`vercel.json` rewrites every request path to that one function.

1. In the Vercel project's **Settings → General → Root Directory**, set it
   to `backend` (this repo has multiple apps at the root).
2. In **Storage**, create a Postgres database and connect it to the
   project — this sets `DATABASE_URL` (or an equivalent env var; if it's
   named differently, e.g. `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`, add a `DATABASE_URL` env
   var pointing to the same pooled connection string so Prisma finds it).
3. Set `JWT_SECRET` (any long random string) as an env var.
4. After the first successful deploy, run `npm run prisma:deploy` (applies
   migrations) and optionally `npm run prisma:seed` against that same
   `DATABASE_URL` from your local machine or a one-off script.
5. Point the mobile app's `API_BASE_URL` (`mobile/src/api/client.ts`) at
   the deployment's URL instead of `localhost`.

## KYC, payments & SMS are mocked

`src/services/kycService.ts`, `src/services/paymentService.ts` and
`src/services/smsService.ts` each export an interface plus a `Mock*`/dev
implementation used by default
(`KYC_PROVIDER_MODE`/`PAYMENT_PROVIDER_MODE`/`SMS_PROVIDER_MODE=mock`). No
real money, real identity data, or real SMS ever moves through these.
Before accepting real users, implement `LiveKycProvider` /
`LivePaymentProvider` against a licensed KYC vendor and a
gambling-licensed payment processor, get a `FAST2SMS_API_KEY`, then flip
the mode env vars to `live`. See the root `README.md` for the full
compliance checklist, including the RNG certification requirement for
`/games/:gameKey/play`.
